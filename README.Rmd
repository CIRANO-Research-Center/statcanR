The goal of the statcanR package is to access Statistics Canada's open economic data
(formerly known as CANSIM tables, now identified by Product IDs (PID)) in an easy manner using R and following the new Statistics Canada Web Data Service framework.

## Installation

The released version of statcanR package is accessible through devtools.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('warint/statcanR')
```

## Example

This is a basic example that shows how to create a data frame directly from a Statistics Canada's economic indicator:

``` r
library(statcanR)
mydata <- sqs_statcan_data("14-10-0287-03","eng")
```
