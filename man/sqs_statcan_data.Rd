\details{
The
\code{_sqs_statcan_data_} function has 2 arguments to fulfill to get data: {tableNumber} & {lang}

The tableNumber argument simply referes to the table number of the Statistics Canada data table you want to collect,
such as '14-10-0287-03' for the Labour force characteristics by province, monthly, seasonally adjusted_ as an example.

The second argument, lang, referes to the language. As Canada is a billingual country (french speaking in Quebec and english speaking in the other provinces), Statistics Canada display all Statistics Data in both languages.
Therefore, users can choose if they want to get satistics data table in french or english by seting the lang argument by c("fra", "eng").
